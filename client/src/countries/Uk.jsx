        <h1>10 Top Tourist Attractions in UNITED KINGDOM</h1><button className='plan1'><a href="https://traveltriangle.com/tour-packages/uk" className='plan1'>(package!)</a></button>
        <p>Consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom (UK) has long been one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. For most travelers, like me, the country's appeal has as much to do with its diverse scenery as it does its rich cultural heritage. In fact, the best places to visit in the UK include everything from beautifully preserved country estates and picturesque castles to its many big city art galleries and museums.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h2>London</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/ENG/uk-best-places-london.jpg" />
            <p> London is a fascinating city laden with history, filled with museums and art galleries, beautiful green parks, fantastic shopping and dining, a vibrant theater scene, and, of course, royalty. London is truly a city that has it all.The English capital is a city that is steeped in history, from its museums and palaces to historic buildings such as Westminster Abbey, the final resting place for many of the country’s greatest individuals, from writers to statesmen to royalty.</p>

            <h2> Scottish Highlands</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-the-uk/scottish_highlands.jpg" />
            <p>The Scottish Highlands is the rugged northern and northwestern portion of Scotland. This is the Scotland conjured up by visions of tartan, kilts, lochs and Braveheart. The area is very sparsely populated, with many mountain ranges dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in Britain, Ben Nevis.

The Highlands are home to many stunning castles including Dunrobin Castle and Eilean Donan Castle, a real picture postcard castle, situated on its own small island in Loch Duich. Only reachable by crossing a stone bridge it was remodeled several times into an ‘ideal’ castle and is well worth a visit, with some interesting rooms and exhibits. Scotland’s most famous lake, Loch Ness can also be found in the Highlands. </p>
          </li>

            <h2>Stonehenge</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/ENG/uk-best-places-stonehenge-salisbury.jpg" />
            <p> One of the most famous sites in the world, Stonehenge is composed of earthworks surrounding a circular setting of large standing stones in south west England. It is also home to some of the most important Neolithic and Bronze Age finds and structures in the UK, and contains some 200 scheduled monuments.

Stonehenge was built in three stages. The first stage, built in approximately 3100 B.C, was the original Henge. It consisted of a circular ditch, an earthen bank and Aubrey holes. Aubrey holes are circular pits in the chalk layer of the earth that are about one meter wide. Experts believe that the pits were used in religious ceremonies or for burials. The site was abandoned not long after the completion of this first stage, and it was not used for more than 1000 years.</p>

            <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
            <img className="image"  src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-the-uk/edinburgh.jpg" />
            <p> Visitors to Edinburgh need to be prepared to experience history, from the cobblestone streets to Edinburgh Castle that is symbolic of Scotland’s capital. Edinburgh is steeped in history, beginning with the Old and New Towns, which have more than 4,500 historic buildings and sites between them.

Edinburgh Castle, which sits high atop a hill overlooking the city, represents Old Town and its rich history. Old Town is home to Edinburgh’s most famous street, the Royal Mile that connects Edinburgh Castle with the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Walking the Royal Mile is where many people begin their visit to Edinburgh. After this trek, travelers may want to visit Grassmarket, a medieval market place where public executions once took place. The White Hart Inn, once frequented by Robert Burns, remains in business today.</p>

            <h2>York</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/walled-cities-in-the-world/york.jpg" />
            <p> York is a walled city with a rich heritage located where the River Foss meets the River Ouse. An impressive number of attractions are packed into the space of this ancient city. York is just a two-hour train ride away from London.

Plenty of exciting sights compete for visitors’ attention as they stroll along the city’s cobblestone streets. One of the city’s landmarks is York Minster. This commanding stone cathedral is filled with remarkable works of art. Children are unlikely to be bored thanks to “explorer baskets” and other activities geared toward young people at the cathedral.</p>

            <h2>Cornwall</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-the-uk/cornwall.jpg" />
            <p>Cornwall is a study in contrasts. It is charming and quaint, yet rugged and isolated. Located in the westernmost point of the United Kingdom, Cornwall is a peninsula that offers rocky cliffs overlooking the sea on its northern side and golden sand beaches that are loved by tourists on the south.

Pirates and smugglers called Cornwall home in the days of yore. Surrounded by water, except for the boundary with Devonshire, Cornwall’s beaches were perfect for such activities, eventually leading to a romanticization of these activities in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, “The Pirates of Penzance”. </p>

            <h2>Chester</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-the-uk/chester.jpg" />
            <p>Not far from the border with Wales, the city of Chester lies on the River Dee in Cheshire, England. The city is more than 2,000 years old, which means there is plenty of history, culture and architecture on hand spanning several eras. Distinctive 19th century black-and-white revival architecture can be found throughout the city.

The Roman and medieval walls encircling the city are a big tourist attraction. After their defensive function became unnecessary, they were converted into an elevated walkway around the city. A walk around the complete two-mile circuit takes about an hour, but most visitors will find plenty to stop and marvel at along the way. </p>

            <h2>Snowdonia</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-the-uk/snowdonia.jpg" />
            <p> Snowdonia is an awesome national park. There is simply no other way to describe the stunning 360-degree views of the mountains, valleys and coast below. On a clear day, visitors can even see Ireland. Located along the coast of Wales, Snowdonia is home to Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales and England, and the largest lake in Wales. It is the third largest national park in the United Kingdom.

The national park is a dream come true for hikers and mountain bikers, but even couch potatoes can find walks suitable for them. Climbing Snowdon will challenge most hikers, but other trails can be walked comfortably by those wearing regular walking shoes. Snowdonia even offers a narrow-gauge railway for those who prefer to view stunning scenery in comfort.</p>

            <h2>Lake District</h2>
            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/tourist-attractions-in-england/lake_district.jpg" />
            <p>Located in north west England in the county of Cumbria, the Lake District is the second largest National Park in the UK. The main attractions are the lakes, mountains and hills carved by glacial erosion and providing dramatic and inspiring scenery. It is England’s premier destination for hiking and climbing. Among the most popular places to visit in the United Kingdom, the park is visited by about 14 million tourists each year. </p>

            <img className="image" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-the-uk/cambridge.jpg" />
            <p> Cambridge is a charming English city located on the River Cam just north of London. As the home to one of the world’s top universities, the University of Cambridge, it has all of the cultural and entertainment options you might expect from a college town.

Cambridge touts itself as a “city for all seasons”. There is no shortage of things to do even on the coldest winter day, and the options are seemingly unlimited when the warmer weather sets in.</p>
